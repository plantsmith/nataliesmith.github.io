These ecosystems function as natural sponges, absorbing wave energy and significantly reducing flood risk. This report evaluates the economic value of restoring 60 hectares of salt marsh in Huntington Beach, California, employing a benefits transfer analysis.\n\n![Photo from Huntington Beach Wetlands Conservancy](wetland.jpg)\n\n# Restoration Costs\n\nData from Bayraktov et al. (2015) was incorporated, which included a meta-analysis of the restoration costs associated with coastal wetlands. Furthermore, insights from Costanza et al. (2021) were utilized, as this research estimated the storm protection benefits of wetlands through calculations of avoided damages.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\n#import data\ncost_df <- read.csv(here(\"portfolio\",\"benefits_transfer\", \"cost_df.csv\"))\n\n#inspect the dataset\n#unique(cost_df$wetland_type)\n\n#filter dataset for wetlands type\nwetland_df <- cost_df %>% \n  filter(wetland_type == \"saltmarsh\") %>% \n  drop_na()\n\n#create a new variable with restoration costs per hectare\nwetland_df <- wetland_df %>%\n  mutate(cost_per_ha = total_cost_2010 / area_ha)\n\n#show me the study with the closest area to 60 hectares\n# wetland_df %>% \n#   filter(area_ha > 40 & area_ha < 100) %>% \n#   select(observation, area_ha, total_cost_2010, cost_per_ha)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nDrawing from the insights provided by Bayraktov et al. (2015) and Costanza et al. (2021), and exploring the data, a comparable study area (observation ID: 126) was selected as a proxy for our location. This study reported a restoration cost of \\$213,689.90 per hectare for a 44.5-hectare salt marsh. Using this as a basis for analysis, the estimated total cost for restoring a 60-hectare area was calculated to be \\$12,821,394.\n\n## Exploring Marginal Costs\n\nTo determine the marginal cost of restoring each additional hectare, I analyzed the data using a scatter plot with hectares on the y-axis and total restoration costs on the x-axis for projects in the USA.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#filter wetland df to only include USA\nwetland_usa <- wetland_df %>% \n  filter(country==\"USA\")\n\n# Scatter plot with log-transformed axes\nggplot(wetland_usa, aes(x = total_cost_2010, y =area_ha)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_log10() +  # Log transform x-axis\n  scale_y_log10() +  # Log transform y-axis\n  labs(title = \"Total Restoration Costs by Saltmarsh Area\",\n       x = \"Saltmarsh Area (ha, log scale)\",\n       y = \"Total Restoration Costs (USD2010, log scale)\") +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Figure 1: Scatterplot illustrating the relationship between total restoration costs and salt marsh area restored, using log-transformed variables.](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot, which features log-transformed variables to better visualize the trends, illustrates a positive trend between total restoration costs and the area of saltmarsh restored, though the relationship isnâ€™t strictly linear. The costs fluctuate suggesting that the marginal cost per additional hectare isn't constant.\n\n## Regression Analysis\n\nBased on the aformentioned studies, a regression model (*total_cost_2010 = a + b\\*area_ha + error)* was used to refine the cost estimate for 60 hectares.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# run regression\nlm_cost <- lm(total_cost_2010 ~ area_ha, data = wetland_usa)\n\n# display results\nsummary(lm_cost)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = total_cost_2010 ~ area_ha, data = wetland_usa)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-5239511  -541661  -352808    87971  7111292 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

However, ncorporating variables like ecological complexity could improve cost accuracy.\n\n# Storm Protection Benefits\n\nCostanza et al. (2021) analyzed 1288 coastal storms globally to calculate the storm protection benefits from wetlands. The authors obtained the following regression estimates:\n\n$$\nln(damages/GDP) = -7.992 - 0.236ln(wetlands) + 3.298ln(wind speed) - \n0.55ln(speed) + 0.137(volume) - 0.058(time)\n$$\n\nThe coefficient for ln(wetlands) indicates that a 1% increase in wetland area correlates with a 0.236% decrease in damages relative to GDP, emphasizing the protective benefits of larger wetlands.\n\n## Avoiding Estimated Damages\n\nAn estimate of avoided damages was calculated using a benefits transfer approach. By applying the elasticity of damages with respect to wetland area (-0.236), which was derived from existing studies, we can estimate the impact of restoring additional wetlands. Given the current wetland area of 72 hectares and the potential expansion by 60 hectares, with total storm damages amounting to \\$18 million, the benefits transfer method predicts that restoring 60 hectares of wetlands would avoid approximately \\$2.4 million in economic damages during storms like Hurricane Hilary.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#ln(damages/GDP) = -7.992 - 0.236ln(wetlands) + 3.298ln(wind speed) - \n#0.55ln(speed) + 0.137(volume) - 0.058(time)\n\n#calculate change in wetland \ncurrent_wetland_area <- 72\nadditional_wetland_area <- 60\ntotal_wetland_area <- current_wetland_area + additional_wetland_area \n# 72 + 60 = 132\n\n\nln_wetland <- log(total_wetland_area/current_wetland_area)\n# ln_wetland\n#log(132/72) = 0.6061358034\n\n#reduction in damages\nln_damages <- -0.236 * ln_wetland\n# - 0.236 * 0.6061358034 = -0.1430480496\n# ln_damages\n\n#calculate damage\ndamages <- 18000000  \ndamage_new <- damages * exp(ln_damages)\n#18,000,000 * exp(-0.1430480496)\n# damage_new\n\navoided_damage = damages - damage_new\n#18000000 - 15600824 = 2399176\navoided_damage #million\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 2399176\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n",
