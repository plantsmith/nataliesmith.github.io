My focus was on identifying patterns and trends in fish passage based on time and season. Additionally, I aimed to determine the annual counts for each species. .\n\n![Adult Male Coho Salmon, BLM](coho.jpeg)\n\n# Part 1: Original Time Series\n\n## Attach libraries:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(tsibble)\nlibrary(feasts)\nlibrary(fable)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(viridis)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Import and Wrangle Data:\n\nIn preparing the data, I transformed it into a time series format and converted the date column from character to date format. I then pivoted the data to consolidate fish species into a single column for streamlined analysis. Finally, any missing values were replaced with zeros to ensure data integrity.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Import Data\n\nwillamette_fish <- read.csv(here(\"portfolio\",\"fish_passage\",\"willamette_fish_passage.csv\"))\n\n# Clean up data\nwf_clean <- willamette_fish %>%\n  janitor::clean_names() %>% \n  mutate(date=lubridate::mdy(date)) %>% \n  as_tsibble(key=NULL,index=date) %>% \n  pivot_longer(!c(project,date),names_to = \"species\",values_to = \"number_of_salmon\") %>% \n  filter(species %in% c(\"coho\",\"jack_coho\",\"steelhead\")) %>% \n  replace_na(list(fish_ob=0))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Time Series Graph:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(wf_clean, aes(x = date, y = number_of_salmon, color = species)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  facet_wrap(~ species, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 1, labeller = labeller(fish_species = c(\"coho\" = \"Coho\", \"jack_coho\" = \"Jack Coho\", \"steelhead\" = \"Steelhead\"))) +\n  labs(x = \"Date\", y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"1 year\", date_labels = \"%Y\") +\n  scale_color_viridis_d(name = \"species\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Time series analysis of adult passage for Coho, Jack Coho, and Steelhead Salmon from 2001 to 2010.](index_files/figure-html/fig-time-series-1.png){#fig-time-series width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Major patterns and notable trends:\n\nCoho species exhibit a left-skewed pattern, with passage counts consistently increasing since 2009. Jack Coho species display a more uniform distribution, reaching peak passage counts in 2009. Steelhead demonstrate a consistent seasonal pattern throughout the analyzed time period.\n\n# Part 2: Seasonplots\n\n## Monthly and Weekly Seasonal Patterns:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwf_season <-wf_clean %>% \n  group_by(species) %>% \n  summarize(monthly_count=sum(number_of_salmon))   \n  \n wf_season %>% gg_season(y=monthly_count, pal = viridis::viridis(8))+\n  facet_wrap(~ species, scales = \"free_y\", ncol = 1, \n             labeller = labeller(fish_species = c(\"coho\" = \"Coho\",\n                                                  \"jack_coho\" = \"Jack Coho\",\n                                                  \"steelhead\" = \"Steelhead\"))) +\n  labs(x='',y='Monthly Fish Passage')+\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"1 month\", date_labels = \"%b\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Total monthly returns of Salmon at Williamette River Dam.

Coho passage has increased in recent years, while Jack Coho passage has declined.\n\n-   Steelhead show a wider seasonal passage window, spanning from February to July, with a peak typically observed from May to July. The timing of peak passage varies across years.\n\n-   Late April and May mark the peak return period for Steelhead, although total returns during this period have declined over the years. This suggests a potential shift in the timing of returns, which is more evident when analyzing the data on a weekly basis.\n\n# Part 3: Annual Counts by Species\n\n## Approach:\n\nTo analyze annual counts for each species, I aggregated the data by year and fish species, calculating the total count for each year and species.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsalmon_by_year <- wf_clean%>%\n  group_by(year = lubridate::year(date),species) %>% \n  summarize(annual_count = sum(number_of_salmon)) %>% \n  ungroup()\n\nyear_count <- aggregate(annual_count ~ year + species, data = salmon_by_year, FUN = sum)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Annual Count Graph:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nannual_salmon_plot_line <- year_count %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = annual_count, color = species)) +\n  geom_line() + \n  scale_color_viridis_d() + \n  labs(x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Count\",\n       color = \"Species\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(salmon_by_year$year), max(salmon_by_year$year), by = 1)) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\nannual_salmon_plot_line\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Annual totals of fish passage for Coho, Jack Coho, and Steelhead Salmon from 2000 to 2010.](index_files/figure-html/fig-annual-count-1.png){#fig-annual-count width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n### Key Trends in Annual Totals by Species (2000 - 2010):\n\n-   The Coho species demonstrates a left-skewed distribution, with a consistent increase over the years, peaking in 2009, followed by a decline in 2010.\n-   Jack Coho species displays a relatively uniform distribution, experiencing a gradual rise in species count from 2007, with a slight decline noted in 2010.\n-   Despite seasonal and annual increases and decreases, Steelhead populations are decreasing overall. The increase in 2009 may be a temporary improvement, but it's crucial to analyze more recent data to determine if this is a consistent upward trend or a small fluctuation.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Reference:\n\nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers, NWD and Chelan, Douglas, and Grant County PUDs, Yakima Klickitat Fisheries Project, Colville Tribes Fish & Wildlife (OBMEP), Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife, Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife.
