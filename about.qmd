title: "About"
---

While I began my career in music (Berklee College of Music), my passion for the environment and innate curiosity about natural systems led me to ecology. After working on restoration projects with the **Audubon Center** and **TreePeople**, I deepened my expertise with a Horticulture Certification (UCLA) and a California Native Plant Landscaper Certificate.

I went on to lead the Native Plant Program at Fig Earth Supply before moving into environmental consulting—supporting ecological assessments, restoration design, and stakeholder engagement with organizations like AECOM, Great Ecology, and LegacyWorks Group.

I recently earned my Master’s degree from the **Bren School of Environmental Science & Management** at UC Santa Barbara, where I focused on conservation planning and climate adaptation. I now work as an environmental scientist with **Stillwater Sciences**, contributing to habitat connectivity, climate resilience, and restoration projects across California. My work blends science and storytelling to advance biodiversity, resilience, and more equitable access to nature.

In my free time, you can find me tending to my garden, at the movies, or listening to old records with a good cup of coffee.
