title: "About"
---

While I began my career in music (Berklee College of Music), my passion for the environment and innate curiosity about natural systems led me to ecology. After working on restoration projects with the **Audubon Center** and **TreePeople**, I deepened my expertise with a Horticulture Certification (UCLA) and a California Native Plant Landscaper Certificate.

Since then, I spearheaded the **Native Plant Program** at Fig Earth Supply, then moved into **environmental consulting**—supporting ecological assessments, restoration projects, and stakeholder engagement with organizations like **AECOM**, **Great Ecology**, and **LegacyWorks Group**. I’m now pursuing my Master’s at the **Bren School of Environmental Science & Management** (UCSB), focusing on conservation planning and climate adaptation.

In my free time, you can find me tending to my garden, at the movies, or listening to old records with a good cup of coffee.
