In combined boxplots, (counter-clockwise from left) we observe a higher count of green leaves in S. repens. In canopy length, we see greater canopy length in S. etonia. Canopy width and height exhibit similar counts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Models:\nTo determine whether a plant is Serenoa repens or Sabal etonia, we need to conduct a binary logistic regression using several predictor variables. We will perform the analysis twice comparing the following models:\n\nModel 1: The log odds of plant type using plant height, canopy length, canopy width, and green leaves as predictor variables.\nModel 2: The log odds of plant type using plant height, canopy width, and green leaves (excluding canopy length for this model).\n\nNote that S. repens = speices 1 and S. etonia = species 2.\n\n\nCode\n# Define formulas:\nf1 &lt;- species ~ height + length + width + green_lvs\nf2 &lt;- species ~ height + width + green_lvs\n\n# BLR:\nblr1 &lt;- glm(formula = f1, data = palmetto, family = binomial)\n\nblr2 &lt;- glm(formula = f2, data = palmetto, family = binomial)\n\n# # Summarize:\n# summary(blr1)\n# summary(blr2)\n\n\nThe coefficients from the binary logistic regression analysis offer insights into the log odds of the predictor variables. In model f1, all predictors have p-values &lt; 0.5, indicating significance. However, upon removing canopy height from the model in f2, the p-value for height is &gt; 0.5, suggesting it is no longer a suitable predictor variable. Additionally, Model f1 presents an AIC of 5194.6, while f2 shows an AIC of 5987.5, indicating that f1 is the preferred model.\n\n\n4 Repeated Cross Validation:\nNext we need to utilize repeated cross-validation (ten-fold cross-validation) using tidymodels for both models.\n\n\nCode\n# Set seed\nset.seed(10101)\n\n# Create folds:\nsurv_folds &lt;- vfold_cv(palmetto, v = 10, repeats = 10)\n\n# Default: \nblr_mdl &lt;- logistic_reg() %&gt;%\n  set_engine('glm') \n\n# Workflows:\nblr_wf1 &lt;- workflow() %&gt;%  \n  add_model(blr_mdl) %&gt;%\n  add_formula(f1)\n\nblr_wf2 &lt;- workflow() %&gt;%  \n  add_model(blr_mdl) %&gt;%\n  add_formula(f2)\n\n#apply to folded datasetls: \nblr_fit_folds1 &lt;- blr_wf1 %&gt;%\n  fit_resamples(surv_folds)\n\nblr_fit_folds2 &lt;- blr_wf2 %&gt;%\n  fit_resamples(surv_folds)\n\n# blr_fit_folds1\n# blr_fit_folds2\n\n# # Metrics:\n# collect_metrics(blr_fit_folds1)\n# collect_metrics(blr_fit_folds2)\n\n\nThe metrics show:\n\nF1 has a mean accuracy of approximately 92% and a mean ROC of approximately 97%.\nF2 has a mean accuracy of approximately 90% and a mean ROC of approximately 96%.\n\nBased on these metrics, F1 appears to be the better performing model, as it has higher values for both accuracy and ROC.\n\n\n5 Train on Full Dataset:\nNow that we have decided the F1 is the better predicting model, we want to train the model on the entire dataset.\n\n\nCode\nblr_fit_full &lt;- blr_mdl %&gt;%\n  fit(formula = f1, data = palmetto)\n\npalmetto_predict &lt;- palmetto %&gt;% \n  mutate(predict(blr_fit_full,new_data = .))\n\n\nThe results of the BLR model are presented below:\n\n\nCode\n# Broom::Tidy \ntidy_output &lt;- tidy(blr_fit_full)\n\n# Create kable table with title\ncoef_table &lt;- kable(tidy_output, align = \"c\")%&gt;%\n  kable_styling() \n\ncoef_table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\n\n\nestimate\n\n\nstd.error\n\n\nstatistic\n\n\np.value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n\n\n3.2266851\n\n\n0.1420708\n\n\n22.71180\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nheight\n\n\n-0.0292173\n\n\n0.0023061\n\n\n-12.66984\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nlength\n\n\n0.0458233\n\n\n0.0018661\n\n\n24.55600\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nwidth\n\n\n0.0394434\n\n\n0.0021000\n\n\n18.78227\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\ngreen_lvs\n\n\n-1.9084747\n\n\n0.0388634\n\n\n-49.10728\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Binary logistic regression results for the F1 model applied to the entire Palmetto dataset.\n\n\n\n\nTo assess the model’s accuracy for identifying plant species correctly, we need to introduce a conditional argument: if the predicted probability is greater than or equal to 50%, the plant is classified as species 1; otherwise, it is classified as species 2. We can then construct a table illustrating the count of correctly and incorrectly classified plants from the original dataset by the model, as well as a column displaying the percentage of plants correctly classified.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate predicted species based on probabilities and 50% cutoff\npalmetto_predict_prob&lt;- augment(blr_fit_full, new_data = palmetto, type.predict = 'response') %&gt;% \n    mutate(predicted_species = ifelse(.pred_1 &gt;= 0.5, \"1\", \"2\")) %&gt;%\n  select(predicted_species, everything())\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Create a table of observed and predicted species\n\n# results_table &lt;- table(palmetto_predict_prob %&gt;% \n#   select(predicted_species, species))\n# \n# tidy(results_table)\n\nspecies &lt;- c('S.

    "title": "Ailanthus altissima: Strategies for Control and Management in California",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Background:\nThe Tree of Heaven (Ailanthus altissima) is a fast-growing invasive species originally from China. Introduced as an ornamental plant, it has spread extensively beyond its native range, particularly throughout California. With prolific seed production and aggressive root suckering, A. altissima exhibits high reproductive capacity. Its allelopathic properties further enable it to outcompete and displace native plant communities (DiTomaso et al., 2013). This species thrives in a wide range of habitats but is especially common in disturbed areas, riparian zones, and foothills. Additionally, A. altissima demonstrates significant growth potential under warmer and drier conditions, suggesting it may expand further with climate change (Knüsel et al., 2019; Motti et al., 2021).\n\n\n\nClockwise from left: Ailanthus altissima invasion (Joseph DiTomaso), Fruit (Bill Johnson), Foliage (Deborah Richardson)\n\n\n\n\nProblem:\nOnce A. altissima has been established in an area, it is difficult to remove and can alter ecosystem function. Herbicide application is often the most effective way to kill the root system, but successful eradication is not guaranteed, and repeated application is often necessary (DiTomaso et al., 2013). This can be costly. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the current and future distribution of A. altissima in California to prioritize areas for monitoring and removal.\n\n\nApproach:\nWe integrated 1,000 presence records of Ailanthus altissima with seven climate variables to develop a MaxEnt species distribution model using Wallace in R. Occurrence data was obtained from GBIF. Given A. altissima’s sensitivity to temperature and precipitation, we selected bioclimatic variables at a 5-arcminute resolution, including annual mean temperature, mean diurnal range, maximum temperature of the warmest month, minimum temperature of the coldest month, annual precipitation, precipitation of the wettest month, and precipitation of the driest quarter.\nTo improve processing efficiency, we restricted occurrence data to the United States and applied a 2.5-degree buffer around all occurrences to define the background extent—excluding unsuitable areas (e.g., oceans) while capturing potentially suitable habitat based on the species’ current distribution. Model validation was performed using 1,000 background points spatially partitioned into four blocks (k=4).\nSince our primary focus is A. altissima’s distribution in California, we projected the model onto a California-specific extent. To assess potential climate-driven range shifts, we also projected future distribution under the highest emissions scenario (SSP 585) for the 2041–2060 period.\n\n\nResults:\nFigures 1 and 2 suggest that Ailanthus altissima is likely to shift northeastward, with a new hotspot projected to emerge in the northeastern corner of California. Both current and future distribution models indicate a strong concentration of A. altissima in the Central Valley. Additionally, the species is predominantly found in and around urban centers, highlighting its preference for disturbed environments.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Current Projected Ailanthus altissima Distribution in California. Species distribution was modeled using MaxEnt. A. altissima distribution was projected to be low (0.00384) in blue areas, moderate in yellow, and high (0.7859) in red areas. (Priscilla Ta)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Future Projected Ailanthus altissima Distribution in California. Future A. altissima distribution was projected under SSP 585 over 2041-2060 in California using MaxEnt modeling. Areas of high (0.91) suitability are noted in red. Areas of low suitability (0.008) are blue. (Natalie Smith)\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nInvasive control efforts should prioritize urban areas where Ailanthus altissima threatens local habitats and ecosystem functionality. We recommend targeted removal in these regions, paired with the reintroduction of native vegetation to restore ecological balance. This strategy would not only curb the species’ spread but also help mitigate urban climate challenges such as the heat island effect and stormwater runoff while enhancing biodiversity. Additionally, establishing an early detection and rapid response program in northeastern California would be crucial for preventing further expansion.\nFuture research should consider additional factors influencing A. altissima distribution, including road networks, land use patterns, and topography, to refine management strategies. Moreover, a balanced assessment of its ecological risks and potential benefits is needed to determine whether A. altissima could contribute to novel ecosystems in certain contexts (Sladonja et al., 2015). While the species may offer some advantages in highly altered environments, its aggressive spread requires careful regulation to prevent further ecological disruption.\n\n\nReferences:\nDiTomaso, J.M., Kyser, G.B., Oneto, S.R., Wilson, R.G., Orloff, S.B., Anderson, L.W., Wright, S.D., Roncoroni, J.A., Miller, T.L., Prather, T.S., Ransom, C., Beck, K.G., Duncan, C., Wilson, K.A., & Mann, J.J.

This air pollution survey data offers insights into citywide air pollution levels, with samples collected seasonally for two weeks, focusing on six contaminants. Monitor locations were strategically chosen to encompass diverse neighborhood characteristics and potential emission sources, including 15 environmental justice sites in low-income areas. For out analysis, we focused on the pollutants with annual averages: NO, NO2, PM2.5, and BC.\n\n\nConceptual Model and Methods:\nWe took the following steps in our analysis:\n\nStarted with four air quality rasters, census tract data, and zoning data\nIdentified zoning types corresponding to industry in NYC and selectively utilized this data through attribute selection.\nReprojected all data to WGS 1984 Zone 18N and converted two polygons to rasters\nResampled our data to 30m for more granularity\nReclassified the data into three quantiles, with the original intention of using EPA recommendations but faced challenges in obtaining relevant data.\nCombined the rasters using raster calculator to provide an overview of general air quality across the city, categorized into low, medium, and high levels.\nConducted zonal statistics (majority) with both census and industrial data, followed by zonal statistics by table to obtain specific values for each tract and industrial zone.\nJoined these values back to the original polygons.\nEmployed summary statistics to determine the mean value for all census tracts and industrial districts.\nSymbolized the data based on values from the raster calculator and zonal statistics, categorized into low, medium, and high air quality levels for ease of interpretation.\n\n\n\nNYC Air Quality, Census Tracts:\nThere are relative disparities in air quality across all boroughs based on census data. Values obtained from our model ranged from 4 to 12, which were subsequently categorized into three groups: low, medium, and high. These categories were symbolized on the map for visualization, with darker colors indicating higher pollution. Additionally, a mean value of 9.72 was calculated to facilitate comparison with our industrial districts.\nAdditional analysis conducted by my colleague, Sam Lance, on industrial districts confirms our findings. Industrial areas show similar air quality trends to census tracts, with the most severe pollution centered around Manhattan and neighboring parts of Brooklyn and Queens. The majority mean air quality index in industrial zones is 10.91, surpassing the average for census tracts, highlighting the need for further investigation into industrial emissions’ impact on air quality.\n\n\nReferences:\n\nData Sources:\nNew York City Community Air Survey: Air Pollution Rasters 2020\nPM 2.5, Black Carbon, Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and Nitric Oxide (NO), Sulfur dioxide (SO2)\nNYC Department of City Planning (DCP), Borough Boundaries (Polygon)\nNYC Department of City Planning (DCP), Zoning Features (Polygon)\nNYC Department of City Planning (DCP), Census Tracts 2020 (Polygon)\n\n\nStudies:\nNew York City Community Air Survey.

    "text": "Simulation of Portfolio Performance\nA Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to model financial and environmental outcomes across 100 randomized scenarios over a 5-year period (60 months). The simulation begins with an initial investment of $10,000, which was randomly allocated across a portfolio of 10 companies. These allocations were normalized to ensure they summed to 1, ensuring proportional distribution across the portfolio. Monthly returns for each company were generated using a normal distribution based on historical average returns. To reflect monthly values, the mean return was divided by 12, and the standard deviation was adjusted by the square root of 12. Portfolio performance was tracked throughout the simulation by applying monthly portfolio returns, calculated as the weighted sum of company-level returns based on their allocation to the portfolio’s value. Individual company portfolio values were also tracked to assess their contributions to the overall portfolio performance. At the end of each simulation, the cumulative return was determined as the percentage change in the portfolio’s value relative to the initial investment, representing total gain or loss over the 5-year period.\nEmissions were calculated for each company by multiplying its allocated portion of the initial investment by its emissions intensity, measured as CO2emission per unit of revenue. These emissions were then multiplied by the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). The total environmental cost for each scenario was obtained by summing the costs across all companies in the portfolio.\nVolatility was calculated at both the company and portfolio levels throughout the simulation. Company-level volatility was determined by annualizing the standard deviation of monthly returns, while portfolio volatility represented the overall risk, combining all companies’ performance. After completing all 100 scenarios, results were aggregated to analyze trends in financial returns, environmental costs, and volatility, providing insights into the trade-offs between financial and environmental metrics for green and brown firms.\n\n\nCode\n#set up initial variables\nset.seed(123)  #for reproducibility\ninitial_investment &lt;- 10000 # starting investment is 10k\nn_scenarios &lt;- 100  #number of scenarios to simulate\nn_months &lt;- 60  #simulation for 5 years (60 months)\n\n# Initialize results list to store each scenario's data before combining\nresults_list &lt;- vector(\"list\", n_scenarios)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Run scenarios to simulate random allocation\nfor (i in 1:n_scenarios) {\n  # Random allocation for each company\n  allocation &lt;- runif(length(tickers))\n  allocation &lt;- allocation / sum(allocation)  # Normalize to sum to 1\n  \n  # Generate monthly returns for each company\n  company_monthly_returns &lt;- matrix(rnorm(n_months * length(tickers), avg_return / 12, sd / sqrt(12)),\n                                    nrow = n_months, ncol = length(tickers))\n  \n  # Initialize portfolio value and returns\n  portfolio_value &lt;- initial_investment\n  monthly_portfolio_returns &lt;- numeric(n_months)\n  \n  # Initialize matrix and vectors\n  company_final_returns &lt;- numeric(length(tickers))\n  company_portfolio_values &lt;- matrix(0, nrow = n_months, ncol = length(tickers))\n  emissions &lt;- initial_investment * allocation * emissions_intensity\n  environmental_cost_allocation &lt;- emissions * SCC\n  \n  # Update portfolio value based on monthly returns and allocation\n  for (j in 1:n_months) {\n    company_returns_at_j &lt;- company_monthly_returns[j, ]  # Returns for all companies at month j\n    \n    # Update portfolio and monthly return\n    portfolio_monthly_return &lt;- sum(company_returns_at_j * allocation)\n    portfolio_value &lt;- portfolio_value * (1 + portfolio_monthly_return)\n    monthly_portfolio_returns[j] &lt;- portfolio_monthly_return\n    \n    # Calculate individual company portfolio values\n    for (k in 1:length(tickers)) {\n      if (j == 1) {\n        company_portfolio_values[j, k] &lt;- initial_investment * allocation[k] * (1 + company_returns_at_j[k])\n      } else {\n        company_portfolio_values[j, k] &lt;- company_portfolio_values[j - 1, k] * (1 + company_returns_at_j[k])\n      }\n    }\n    \n    # Accumulate final returns\n    company_final_returns &lt;- company_final_returns + company_returns_at_j * allocation\n  }\n  \n  # Final calculations outside the monthly loop\n  total_return &lt;- (portfolio_value - initial_investment) / initial_investment\n  total_enviro_cost_scenario &lt;- sum(environmental_cost_allocation)\n  company_final_portfolio_values &lt;- company_portfolio_values[n_months, ]\n  \n  # Calculate volatilities\n  company_volatilities &lt;- apply(company_monthly_returns, 2, sd) * sqrt(12)  # Annualize\n  portfolio_volatility &lt;- sd(monthly_portfolio_returns) * sqrt(12)\n  \n  # Store results\n  results_list[[i]] &lt;- data.frame(\n    scenario = i,\n    company = tickers,\n    allocation = allocation,\n    final_portfolio_value = portfolio_value,\n    total_return = total_return,\n    company_final_return = company_final_returns,\n    company_final_portfolio_value = company_final_portfolio_values,\n    emissions = emissions,\n    environmental_cost_allocation = environmental_cost_allocation,\n    total_enviro_cost_scenario = total_enviro_cost_scenario,\n    company_volatility = company_volatilities,\n    scenario_volatility = portfolio_volatility\n  )\n}\n\n# Combine all results\nresults &lt;- do.call(rbind, results_list)"

Point sources are single, identifiable emitters like power plants and factories, while nonpoint sources are more diffuse, stemming from widespread activities such as residential heating and vehicle emissions.\nI combined these datasets and categorized them by source type, ranking the top emitters by total emissions. The final visualization used a horizontal bar chart to compare pollution sources, with an annotation marking the 100-ton threshold for major contributors. I explored putting the tons emitted at the end of each bar to eliminate the need for the y-axis, but I didn’t like the data-to-ink ratio.\n\n\nCode\n# --- POINT SOURCES -----\n\n# bring in data and clean names\npoint_sources &lt;- read.csv(here(\"portfolio/pm2_5_la/data/sources/facility_point_sources_2020.csv\")) %&gt;% \n  clean_names()\n\n# filter for 2.5 and make emissions numeric\npoint_sources &lt;- point_sources %&gt;% \n  filter(pollutant %in% c(\"PM2.5 Primary (Filt + Cond)\", \"PM2.5 Filterable\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(emissions_tons = as.numeric(emissions_tons))\n\n# EXPLORE TOP EMITTERS ---\n\n# Top 50 emitters\ntop_50_point_sources &lt;- point_sources %&gt;% \n  slice_max(order_by = emissions_tons, n = 50)\n\n\n# Major emitters (100+ tons)\nmajor_point_sources &lt;- point_sources %&gt;% \n  filter(emissions_tons &gt;= 100)\n\n\n# --- NONPOINT SOURCES -----\n\n# bring in data and clean names\n\nnonpoint_sources &lt;- read.csv(here(\"portfolio/pm2_5_la/data/sources/nonpoint_sources_2020.csv\")) %&gt;% \n  clean_names()\n\n# filter for 2.5 and make emissions numeric\nnonpoint_sources &lt;- nonpoint_sources %&gt;% \n  filter(pollutant %in% c(\"PM2.5 Primary (Filt + Cond)\", \"PM2.5 Filterable\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(emissions_tons = as.numeric(emissions_tons)) %&gt;% \n  drop_na()\n\n# EXPLORE TOP EMITTERS ---\n\n# Top 50 emitters for nonpoint sources\ntop_50_nonpoint_sources &lt;- nonpoint_sources %&gt;% \n   slice_max(order_by = emissions_tons, n = 50)\n\n# Major emitters for nonpoint sources\nmajor_nonpoint_sources &lt;- nonpoint_sources %&gt;% \n  filter(emissions_tons &gt;= 100)\n\n# COMBINE SOURCES --  \ncombined_sources &lt;- bind_rows(\n  nonpoint_sources %&gt;% \n    mutate(source_type = \"nonpoint\", # add a new column 'source_type' with the variable \"nonpoint\" for each row\n           pollution_source = eis_sector, # set'pollution_source' column to be equal to the 'eis_sector' column\n           # Add empty columns for point-source-specific fields: \n           site_name = NA,\n           eis_facility_id = NA,\n           facility_type = NA,\n           street_address = NA,\n           naics = NA,\n           lat_lon = NA,\n           longitude = NA,\n           latitude = NA),\n  \n  point_sources %&gt;% \n    mutate(source_type = \"point\",\n           pollution_source = facility_type,  #use facility_type  \" \"\n           # Add empty columns for nonpoint-source-specific fields:\n           scc_code = NA,\n           eis_sector = NA,\n           source_description = NA,\n           scc_level_1 = NA,\n           scc_level_2 = NA,\n           scc_level_3 = NA,\n           scc_level_4 = NA)\n)\n\n# WRANGLE ---\ncombined_sources &lt;- combined_sources %&gt;% \n  select(state_county, \n         pollutant,\n         emissions_tons,\n         source_type,\n         pollution_source)\n\n# EXPLORE COMBINED TOP EMITTERS ----\n\n# Top 50 emitters for all sources\ntop_50_sources &lt;- combined_sources %&gt;% \n   slice_max(order_by = emissions_tons, n = 50)\n\n# Major emitters for all sources (greater than 100 tons)\nmajor_sources &lt;- combined_sources %&gt;% \n  filter(emissions_tons &gt;= 100)\n\n# top 10 \ntop_10_sources &lt;- top_50_sources %&gt;% \n  group_by(pollution_source, source_type) %&gt;% \n  summarise(total_emissions = sum(emissions_tons, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% \n  # summarizes each group by calculating the total emissions for each 'pollution_source' and 'source_type'\n  ungroup() %&gt;% \n  slice_max(order_by = total_emissions, n = 10) %&gt;% # top 10 based on total emissions\n  mutate(pollution_source = recode(pollution_source, # rename variables\n  \"Industrial Processes - Not Elsewhere Classified\" = \"Other Industrial Processes\",\n  \"Fuel Comb - Residential - Wood\" = \"Residential Wood Combustion\",\n  \"Mobile - On-Road non-Diesel Light Duty Vehicles\" = \"Light Duty Vehicles\",\n  \"Dust - Construction Dust\" = \"Construction Dust\",\n  \"Waste Disposal\" = \"Waste Disposal\",\n  \"Petroleum Refinery\" = \"Petroleum Refineries\",\n  \"Fires - Wildfires\" = \"Wildfires\",\n  \"Fuel Comb - Residential - Natural Gas\" = \"Residential Natural Gas Combustion\",\n  \"Miscellaneous Non-Industrial Not Elsewhere Classified\" = \"Other Non-Industrial\",\n  \"Dust - Unpaved Road Dust\" = \"Unpaved Road Dust\"\n))\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#subtitle: \nsubtitle &lt;- glue::glue(\"\n  &lt;span style='color:#DF674F;'&gt;**Point sources**&lt;/span&gt;

    "text": "3.7 Design Elements\nWhen creating an infographic, it’s important to carefully consider various design elements. My goal was for the visualizations to connect and convey a cohesive story. In this section, I’ll walk you through my thought process and the reasoning behind my choices for the design elements listed below.\n\nGraphic FormTextThemesColorsTypographyGeneral DesignContextMessageAccessibilityDEI\n\n\nWhile I experimented with several plot types, I ultimately chose a choropleth map, a bar graph, and a line plot. My goal was to use a variety of shapes to convey dynamic movement between the plots, effectively telling the story of the pollutant. I also experimented with displaying the overall AQI and all the pollutants in the AQI as bubbles, but this approach took attention away from the central focus on PM2.5 pollution in Los Angeles.\n\n\nTo create consistency across my visualizations, you’ll notice that each one includes titles, subtitles, and captions. I also minimized the use of axis titles where they weren’t absolutely necessary. In the final infographic, I moved away from traditional titles and subtitles, opting instead for annotations and colors to provide context and guide the reader through the story. Additionally, I used annotations in both the standalone graphs and the final infographic to emphasize key points, such as the 100-ton threshold for major pollution sources in the bar graph.\n\n\nMy general aesthetic preference is quite minimal, so I chose to keep the plot themes simple to allow the bright colors to stand out. This involved removing legends, axis text, axis lines, and background grids, as previously mentioned. Most of these elements weren’t essential for conveying meaning and could be effectively replaced with annotations in the final graphic.\n\n\nI had a lot of fun experimenting with colors! As mentioned earlier, I chose a photograph of a smoggy downtown Los Angeles, which features distinct layers of smog and sky. Using the color picker in Affinity, I extracted the colors from the image. I then checked them for colorblind accessibility and tested them on a grayscale to ensure they remained distinguishable. To further improve accessibility, I adjusted the saturation and opacity. I’m really happy with the palette I ended up with—it transitions from a cool blue to a bright terracotta, capturing the sky in LA. The cool-to-warm gradient also helps illustrate the progression of pollution levels, from low to high.\n\n\nI used two fonts throughout my infographic to ensure consistency and readability. Montserrat was reserved for the main title, while Open Sans was used for all other text. Both are sans-serif fonts, chosen for their clarity and modern aesthetic—a subtle contrast to the theme of polluted air. To enhance readability and emphasize important details, I used bold text, often paired with color, to highlight key points in annotations and draw attention to critical statistics.\n\n\nI designed the infographic to guide the viewer’s eyes in a natural reading flow—moving from left to right and then down, similar to reading a book. However, I was also mindful that not everyone follows the same reading pattern, so I ensured that each graph could stand alone and be understood in any order. That said, I placed the illustration of PM2.5 and its context right at the top, just below the title, as I felt it was crucial for understanding the rest of the infographic.\n\n\nI spent a lot of time refining the story to ensure it naturally guides the viewer toward key insights while still allowing for personal interpretation. However, I did provide context through the header, the PM2.5 illustration, and concise plot annotations. Instead of over-annotating with additional explanations or takeaways, I used select highlights to guide the reader and let the data speak for itself.\n\n\nWhile this project initially started as an exploration without a specific message in mind, a clear takeaway emerged: PM2.5 pollution in Los Angeles is a significant issue, with distinct spatial and temporal patterns. The infographic serves more as an introductory overview (think — PM2.5 Pollution 101) rather than an in-depth analysis, providing viewers with a foundational understanding of the issue.\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, I created my own color palette based on a photo of smog. Some of the colors were too similar, which could cause accessibility issues for viewers with color blindness or in grayscale. To address this, I adjusted the saturation of certain colors to create more contrast. I also made sure to avoid placing colors that were too similar next to each other, unless they were part of a gradient. Additionally, I added alt text to all of my visuals to further ensure accessibility for all viewers.\n\n\nI knew I wanted to incorporate a DEI aspect into my choropleth map of PM2.5 pollution in Los Angeles. When I noticed pollution hotspots in Reseda and Central Los Angeles, I decided to check if these areas also ranked high on the CalEnviroScreen 4.0 percentile range. The CalEnviroScreen 4.0 percentile range is a tool used to assess the cumulative environmental, health, and socioeconomic impacts in California. Areas are ranked based on factors like water quality, proximity to hazardous waste sites, and poverty levels. Both Reseda and Central Los Angeles ranked very high, indicating they had high cumulative impacts, including both high PM2.5 levels and significant socioeconomic stressors. To represent this, I initially created a bivariate map. However, I faced challenges trying to explain what the CalEnviroScreen percentile range meant in the context of an infographic. To make this easier to interpret, I simplified the map by focusing solely on PM2.5 pollution and poverty. Despite this, I still found it difficult to display the data in a clear and understandable way, as I would need to explain each of the combinations (high pollution, high poverty; low pollution, high poverty, etc.) within the map for it to make sense to viewers. Since the bivariate map and the pollution distribution map looked very similar, I decided to show just the distribution of PM2.5 pollution in Los Angeles, and note the poverty aspect into the annotations. I think this made it easier to understand, but still hits on the major environmental justice issue at play."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background:\nEffective allocation of conservation resources for the California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) and Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) hinges on identifying areas of high conservation priority. Distinguishing between “hotspots,” which represent regions with high species richness under high threat levels, and coldspots, areas of similarly high species richness with lower associated threats, is key to this process. Hotspots may demand more urgent attention, while coldspots may represent zones of population stability, potentially serving as long-term refugia. In this study, we considered a range of threats to sea lion populations, as detailed in Appendix A.\n\n\n\nLeft: Adult California sea lion (NOAA Fisheries) Right: Steller sea lion (National Geographic)\n\n\n\n\nProblem:\nStrategic conservation planning often involves reconciling different stakeholder priorities. A key debate centers on whether to allocate limited resources toward conserving areas of high biodiversity that are under immediate threat (hotspots) or protecting species-rich regions that face fewer immediate risks (coldspots). With constraints on both funding and capacity, it is crucial to adopt a data-driven approach that balances these competing objectives.\n\n\nApproach:\nWe began by creating a comprehensive species richness layer by summing the individual species distribution layers. Probabilities were converted to binary presence/absence data, where presence (1) represented the upper 50th percentile and absence (0) the lower 50th percentile. “No data” cells were recoded as 0 to simplify subsequent raster calculations.\nThe combined species richness layer was then simplified to show areas of presence for either or both species. Specifically, values of 0 were reclassified as ‘NODATA,’ and values of 1 and 2 (indicating the presence of one or both species) were reclassified as 1.\nNext, a threat layer was introduced, representing the cumulative impact of various threats on the marine environment. This layer was categorized into five equal-area quantiles, from which we generated a high-threat layer by reclassifying all but the highest quantile to ‘NODATA.’ We used the same process to create a low-threat layer, isolating the lowest quantile. We ensured consistency by matching cell size and extent between the threat and species richness layers. Finally, we intersected the high and low-threat rasters with the sea lion species richness layer to show areas of high-threat (hotspots) and low-threat (coldspots) relative to sea lion distribution.\n\n\nResults:\nAs shown in Figure 1, sea lion hotspots are concentrated in the northern portion of their range, particularly along the Pacific Northwest coast. In contrast, cold spots are predominantly found in the southern portion of the species range, off the coast of Southern California and Baja.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Sealion (Zalophus californianus and Eumetopias jubatus) Hotspots and Coldspots. Red represents hotspots or areas with high sealion biodiversity and high threat. Blue represents the coldspots or areas with high sealion biodiversity and low threat.\n\n\n\n\nConclusions:\nOur results present a clear distinction in the distribution of threats relative to areas with high sea lion species richness. The northern population is under greater threat and, therefore, may require more urgent conservation action. To mitigate these risks, conservation efforts should be focused in the northern range where more biodiverse populations are facing greater threats. However, it is also important to consider conservation actions in coldspots to prevent future threats, and ensure population resilience. Additionally, safeguarding coldspot zones may create refuge areas for sea lions, helping to maintain overall population stability."
