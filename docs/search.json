    "text": "What is redlining?\nThe Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC), established during the New Deal to stabilize the housing market amidst the Great Depression, aimed to assist struggling homeowners. However, HOLC’s operations also perpetuated racial discrimination in mortgage lending, reflecting prevailing attitudes of the time.\n\nBetween 1935 and 1940, HOLC created area descriptions and color-coded maps to evaluate neighborhoods’ mortgage security. HOLC’s criteria included housing quality, property values, and residents’ racial and ethnic backgrounds. These maps categorized areas into four types:\n\n‘Type A’ neighborhoods outlined in green were considered the most desirable for lending, typically affluent suburbs;\n‘Type B’ neighborhoods outlined in blue were still desirable;\n‘Type C’ neighborhoods outlined in yellow were declining;\n‘Type D’ neighborhoods outlined in red were the riskiest for mortgage support, often older districts in city centers and predominantly Black and People of Color.\n\n\nThese grades were used for redlining, restricting mortgage financing and homeownership opportunities, particularly in communities of color. These discriminatory practices continue to shape urban inequality today.\n\n\n\nHOLC map of Los Angeles County, 1939. Image from Mapping Inequality, University of Richmond’s Digital Scholarship Lab.\n\n\nEnvironmental Implications\nEnvironmental disparities in American cities reflect historic redlining policies that favored wealthy, predominantly white neighborhoods over poorer, often minority communities. Wealthier urban areas tend to have more parks and trees, which combat the urban heat island effect by providing shade and cooling the air temperature. A study led by scientists in 2017-2018 used HOLC redlining maps to investigate the link between discriminatory housing practices and contemporary environmental stressors, particularly heat islands. They found that areas previously redlined by HOLC were significantly hotter than greenlined neighborhoods during summer months, mainly due to differences in surface materials and tree canopy coverage. Subsequent research has confirmed these findings, highlighting the enduring impact of past discriminatory policies on present-day environmental inequalities and public health outcomes.\n\nHealth Implications\nThe mechanisms through which historic redlining influences present-day public health are an ongoing topic of study. Potential contributing factors include economic isolation, disparate property valuation, and environmental exposures.\n\nResearch on redlining and health has intensified since the digitization of HOLC maps, revealing associations between redlined areas and various health indicators such as mortality, pre-term birth, cardiovascular disease, and COVID-19 infection burden. Redlining has also been linked to environmental determinants of health, such as air pollution and access to healthcare services."

    "text": "Introduction\nThis work was completed as part of my Master’s Group Project at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, spanning from April 2024 to April 2025. Our team included Thuy-Tien Bui, Madison Calbert, Andrew Palacios, Priscilla Ta, and myself. We were advised by Dr. Ruth Oliver, and our client was Bill Lehey of LegacyWorks Group.\nCheck out the final report and additional information about the project here.\nA video of our final presentation can be found here (skip to 3:27:00).\n\n\n\nBackground\nOur Master’s Group Project supported the proposed designation of a Vandenberg Sentinel Landscape (VSL) by identifying conservation priorities, implementation barriers, and opportunities for collaboration across California’s Southern Central Coast. We began by interviewing 19 partners to understand their goals and challenges, revealing that biodiversity preservation—including wildlife connectivity and Southern Steelhead recovery—was the region’s top priority. To support these efforts, we conducted a habitat suitability analysis for steelhead and a multispecies connectivity analysis to pinpoint critical conservation areas and movement barriers. Our findings highlighted gaps in monitoring, coordination, and land use compatibility, underscoring the need for expanded partnerships and resource sharing. This work laid the foundation for the VSL designation application and catalyzed the formation of the Vandenberg-Gaviota Landscape Partnership—an important step toward bridging the planning-implementation gap and advancing long-term ecological resilience in the region.\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\n\n  Left: The designation boundary is anchored by Vandenberg Space Force Base, outlined in red, and features federal and state public lands and protected areas.  \n  Right: Example output from the connectivity analysis.The 20 identified barriers differ in majority land ownership types and presence of critical habitat. Publicly owned areas with critical habitat are located within VSFB (polygon 11).\n\n\n\nMy Contributions\nAs Project Manager, I oversaw all aspects of the project to ensure alignment with our client’s goal of applying for designation through the USDA’s Sentinel Landscape Partnership. I managed project timelines, facilitated meetings with clients and advisors, and coordinated collaboration across our five-person team to ensure timely, high-quality deliverables.\nIn addition to my project management responsibilities, I led the design and execution of interviews with 19 regional partners to identify shared conservation priorities and implementation barriers, and contributed to the analysis of qualitative findings. I also played a key role in the habitat connectivity analysis, using Maxent and Circuitscape to model multispecies movement and identify priority areas for corridor protection, restoration, and barrier mitigation. Additionally, I contributed to creating visualizations, writing report sections, and reviewing project materials to ensure clarity, consistency, and scientific accuracy."

    "section": "Simulation of Portfolio Performance",
    "text": "Simulation of Portfolio Performance\nA Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to model financial and environmental outcomes across 100 randomized scenarios over a 5-year period (60 months). The simulation begins with an initial investment of $10,000, which was randomly allocated across a portfolio of 10 companies. These allocations were normalized to ensure they summed to 1, ensuring proportional distribution across the portfolio. Monthly returns for each company were generated using a normal distribution based on historical average returns. To reflect monthly values, the mean return was divided by 12, and the standard deviation was adjusted by the square root of 12. Portfolio performance was tracked throughout the simulation by applying monthly portfolio returns, calculated as the weighted sum of company-level returns based on their allocation to the portfolio’s value. Individual company portfolio values were also tracked to assess their contributions to the overall portfolio performance. At the end of each simulation, the cumulative return was determined as the percentage change in the portfolio’s value relative to the initial investment, representing total gain or loss over the 5-year period.\nEmissions were calculated for each company by multiplying its allocated portion of the initial investment by its emissions intensity, measured as CO2emission per unit of revenue. These emissions were then multiplied by the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). The total environmental cost for each scenario was obtained by summing the costs across all companies in the portfolio.\nVolatility was calculated at both the company and portfolio levels throughout the simulation. Company-level volatility was determined by annualizing the standard deviation of monthly returns, while portfolio volatility represented the overall risk, combining all companies’ performance. After completing all 100 scenarios, results were aggregated to analyze trends in financial returns, environmental costs, and volatility, providing insights into the trade-offs between financial and environmental metrics for green and brown firms.\n\n\nCode\n#set up initial variables\nset.seed(123)  #for reproducibility\ninitial_investment &lt;- 10000 # starting investment is 10k\nn_scenarios &lt;- 100  #number of scenarios to simulate\nn_months &lt;- 60  #simulation for 5 years (60 months)\n\n# Initialize results list to store each scenario's data before combining\nresults_list &lt;- vector(\"list\", n_scenarios)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Run scenarios to simulate random allocation\nfor (i in 1:n_scenarios) {\n  # Random allocation for each company\n  allocation &lt;- runif(length(tickers))\n  allocation &lt;- allocation / sum(allocation)  # Normalize to sum to 1\n  \n  # Generate monthly returns for each company\n  company_monthly_returns &lt;- matrix(rnorm(n_months * length(tickers), avg_return / 12, sd / sqrt(12)),\n                                    nrow = n_months, ncol = length(tickers))\n  \n  # Initialize portfolio value and returns\n  portfolio_value &lt;- initial_investment\n  monthly_portfolio_returns &lt;- numeric(n_months)\n  \n  # Initialize matrix and vectors\n  company_final_returns &lt;- numeric(length(tickers))\n  company_portfolio_values &lt;- matrix(0, nrow = n_months, ncol = length(tickers))\n  emissions &lt;- initial_investment * allocation * emissions_intensity\n  environmental_cost_allocation &lt;- emissions * SCC\n  \n  # Update portfolio value based on monthly returns and allocation\n  for (j in 1:n_months) {\n    company_returns_at_j &lt;- company_monthly_returns[j, ]  # Returns for all companies at month j\n    \n    # Update portfolio and monthly return\n    portfolio_monthly_return &lt;- sum(company_returns_at_j * allocation)\n    portfolio_value &lt;- portfolio_value * (1 + portfolio_monthly_return)\n    monthly_portfolio_returns[j] &lt;- portfolio_monthly_return\n    \n    # Calculate individual company portfolio values\n    for (k in 1:length(tickers)) {\n      if (j == 1) {\n        company_portfolio_values[j, k] &lt;- initial_investment * allocation[k] * (1 + company_returns_at_j[k])\n      } else {\n        company_portfolio_values[j, k] &lt;- company_portfolio_values[j - 1, k] * (1 + company_returns_at_j[k])\n      }\n    }\n    \n    # Accumulate final returns\n    company_final_returns &lt;- company_final_returns + company_returns_at_j * allocation\n  }\n  \n  # Final calculations outside the monthly loop\n  total_return &lt;- (portfolio_value - initial_investment) / initial_investment\n  total_enviro_cost_scenario &lt;- sum(environmental_cost_allocation)\n  company_final_portfolio_values &lt;- company_portfolio_values[n_months, ]\n  \n  # Calculate volatilities\n  company_volatilities &lt;- apply(company_monthly_returns, 2, sd) * sqrt(12)  # Annualize\n  portfolio_volatility &lt;- sd(monthly_portfolio_returns) * sqrt(12)\n  \n  # Store results\n  results_list[[i]] &lt;- data.frame(\n    scenario = i,\n    company = tickers,\n    allocation = allocation,\n    final_portfolio_value = portfolio_value,\n    total_return = total_return,\n    company_final_return = company_final_returns,\n    company_final_portfolio_value = company_final_portfolio_values,\n    emissions = emissions,\n    environmental_cost_allocation = environmental_cost_allocation,\n    total_enviro_cost_scenario = total_enviro_cost_scenario,\n    company_volatility = company_volatilities,\n    scenario_volatility = portfolio_volatility\n  )\n}\n\n# Combine all results\nresults &lt;- do.call(rbind, results_list)"

The timing of peak passage varies across years.\nLate April and May mark the peak return period for Steelhead, although total returns during this period have declined over the years. This suggests a potential shift in the timing of returns, which is more evident when analyzing the data on a weekly basis."

    "title": "Ailanthus altissima: Strategies for Control and Management in California",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Background:\nThe Tree of Heaven (Ailanthus altissima) is a fast-growing invasive species originally from China. Introduced as an ornamental plant, it has spread extensively beyond its native range, particularly throughout California. With prolific seed production and aggressive root suckering, A. altissima exhibits high reproductive capacity. Its allelopathic properties further enable it to outcompete and displace native plant communities (DiTomaso et al., 2013). This species thrives in a wide range of habitats but is especially common in disturbed areas, riparian zones, and foothills. Additionally, A. altissima demonstrates significant growth potential under warmer and drier conditions, suggesting it may expand further with climate change (Knüsel et al., 2019; Motti et al., 2021).\n\n\n\nClockwise from left: Ailanthus altissima invasion (Joseph DiTomaso), Fruit (Bill Johnson), Foliage (Deborah Richardson)\n\n\n\n\nProblem:\nOnce A. altissima has been established in an area, it is difficult to remove and can alter ecosystem function. Herbicide application is often the most effective way to kill the root system, but successful eradication is not guaranteed, and repeated application is often necessary (DiTomaso et al., 2013). This can be costly. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the current and future distribution of A. altissima in California to prioritize areas for monitoring and removal.\n\n\nApproach:\nWe integrated 1,000 presence records of Ailanthus altissima with seven climate variables to develop a MaxEnt species distribution model using Wallace in R. Occurrence data was obtained from GBIF. Given A. altissima’s sensitivity to temperature and precipitation, we selected bioclimatic variables at a 5-arcminute resolution, including annual mean temperature, mean diurnal range, maximum temperature of the warmest month, minimum temperature of the coldest month, annual precipitation, precipitation of the wettest month, and precipitation of the driest quarter.\nTo improve processing efficiency, we restricted occurrence data to the United States and applied a 2.5-degree buffer around all occurrences to define the background extent—excluding unsuitable areas (e.g., oceans) while capturing potentially suitable habitat based on the species’ current distribution. Model validation was performed using 1,000 background points spatially partitioned into four blocks (k=4).\nSince our primary focus is A. altissima’s distribution in California, we projected the model onto a California-specific extent. To assess potential climate-driven range shifts, we also projected future distribution under the highest emissions scenario (SSP 585) for the 2041–2060 period.\n\n\nResults:\nFigures 1 and 2 suggest that Ailanthus altissima is likely to shift northeastward, with a new hotspot projected to emerge in the northeastern corner of California. Both current and future distribution models indicate a strong concentration of A. altissima in the Central Valley. Additionally, the species is predominantly found in and around urban centers, highlighting its preference for disturbed environments.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Current Projected Ailanthus altissima Distribution in California. Species distribution was modeled using MaxEnt. A. altissima distribution was projected to be low (0.00384) in blue areas, moderate in yellow, and high (0.7859) in red areas. (Priscilla Ta)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Future Projected Ailanthus altissima Distribution in California. Future A. altissima distribution was projected under SSP 585 over 2041-2060 in California using MaxEnt modeling. Areas of high (0.91) suitability are noted in red. Areas of low suitability (0.008) are blue. (Natalie Smith)\n\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nInvasive control efforts should prioritize urban areas where Ailanthus altissima threatens local habitats and ecosystem functionality. We recommend targeted removal in these regions, paired with the reintroduction of native vegetation to restore ecological balance. This strategy would not only curb the species’ spread but also help mitigate urban climate challenges such as the heat island effect and stormwater runoff while enhancing biodiversity. Additionally, establishing an early detection and rapid response program in northeastern California would be crucial for preventing further expansion.\nFuture research should consider additional factors influencing A. altissima distribution, including road networks, land use patterns, and topography, to refine management strategies. Moreover, a balanced assessment of its ecological risks and potential benefits is needed to determine whether A. altissima could contribute to novel ecosystems in certain contexts (Sladonja et al., 2015). While the species may offer some advantages in highly altered environments, its aggressive spread requires careful regulation to prevent further ecological disruption.\n\n\nReferences:\nDiTomaso, J.M., Kyser, G.B., Oneto, S.R., Wilson, R.G., Orloff, S.B., Anderson, L.W., Wright, S.D., Roncoroni, J.A., Miller, T.L., Prather, T.S., Ransom, C., Beck, K.G., Duncan, C., Wilson, K.A., & Mann, J.J.

In combined boxplots, (counter-clockwise from left) we observe a higher count of green leaves in S. repens. In canopy length, we see greater canopy length in S. etonia. Canopy width and height exhibit similar counts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Models:\nTo determine whether a plant is Serenoa repens or Sabal etonia, we need to conduct a binary logistic regression using several predictor variables. We will perform the analysis twice comparing the following models:\n\nModel 1: The log odds of plant type using plant height, canopy length, canopy width, and green leaves as predictor variables.\nModel 2: The log odds of plant type using plant height, canopy width, and green leaves (excluding canopy length for this model).\n\nNote that S. repens = speices 1 and S. etonia = species 2.\n\n\nCode\n# Define formulas:\nf1 &lt;- species ~ height + length + width + green_lvs\nf2 &lt;- species ~ height + width + green_lvs\n\n# BLR:\nblr1 &lt;- glm(formula = f1, data = palmetto, family = binomial)\n\nblr2 &lt;- glm(formula = f2, data = palmetto, family = binomial)\n\n# # Summarize:\n# summary(blr1)\n# summary(blr2)\n\n\nThe coefficients from the binary logistic regression analysis offer insights into the log odds of the predictor variables. In model f1, all predictors have p-values &lt; 0.5, indicating significance. However, upon removing canopy height from the model in f2, the p-value for height is &gt; 0.5, suggesting it is no longer a suitable predictor variable. Additionally, Model f1 presents an AIC of 5194.6, while f2 shows an AIC of 5987.5, indicating that f1 is the preferred model.\n\n\n4 Repeated Cross Validation:\nNext we need to utilize repeated cross-validation (ten-fold cross-validation) using tidymodels for both models.\n\n\nCode\n# Set seed\nset.seed(10101)\n\n# Create folds:\nsurv_folds &lt;- vfold_cv(palmetto, v = 10, repeats = 10)\n\n# Default: \nblr_mdl &lt;- logistic_reg() %&gt;%\n  set_engine('glm') \n\n# Workflows:\nblr_wf1 &lt;- workflow() %&gt;%  \n  add_model(blr_mdl) %&gt;%\n  add_formula(f1)\n\nblr_wf2 &lt;- workflow() %&gt;%  \n  add_model(blr_mdl) %&gt;%\n  add_formula(f2)\n\n#apply to folded datasetls: \nblr_fit_folds1 &lt;- blr_wf1 %&gt;%\n  fit_resamples(surv_folds)\n\nblr_fit_folds2 &lt;- blr_wf2 %&gt;%\n  fit_resamples(surv_folds)\n\n# blr_fit_folds1\n# blr_fit_folds2\n\n# # Metrics:\n# collect_metrics(blr_fit_folds1)\n# collect_metrics(blr_fit_folds2)\n\n\nThe metrics show:\n\nF1 has a mean accuracy of approximately 92% and a mean ROC of approximately 97%.\nF2 has a mean accuracy of approximately 90% and a mean ROC of approximately 96%.\n\nBased on these metrics, F1 appears to be the better performing model, as it has higher values for both accuracy and ROC.\n\n\n5 Train on Full Dataset:\nNow that we have decided the F1 is the better predicting model, we want to train the model on the entire dataset.\n\n\nCode\nblr_fit_full &lt;- blr_mdl %&gt;%\n  fit(formula = f1, data = palmetto)\n\npalmetto_predict &lt;- palmetto %&gt;% \n  mutate(predict(blr_fit_full,new_data = .))\n\n\nThe results of the BLR model are presented below:\n\n\nCode\n# Broom::Tidy \ntidy_output &lt;- tidy(blr_fit_full)\n\n# Create kable table with title\ncoef_table &lt;- kable(tidy_output, align = \"c\")%&gt;%\n  kable_styling() \n\ncoef_table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\n\n\nestimate\n\n\nstd.error\n\n\nstatistic\n\n\np.value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n\n\n3.2266851\n\n\n0.1420708\n\n\n22.71180\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nheight\n\n\n-0.0292173\n\n\n0.0023061\n\n\n-12.66984\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nlength\n\n\n0.0458233\n\n\n0.0018661\n\n\n24.55600\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nwidth\n\n\n0.0394434\n\n\n0.0021000\n\n\n18.78227\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\ngreen_lvs\n\n\n-1.9084747\n\n\n0.0388634\n\n\n-49.10728\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Binary logistic regression results for the F1 model applied to the entire Palmetto dataset.\n\n\n\n\nTo assess the model’s accuracy for identifying plant species correctly, we need to introduce a conditional argument: if the predicted probability is greater than or equal to 50%, the plant is classified as species 1; otherwise, it is classified as species 2.

    "text": "Background:\nEffective allocation of conservation resources for the California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) and Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) hinges on identifying areas of high conservation priority. Distinguishing between “hotspots,” which represent regions with high species richness under high threat levels, and coldspots, areas of similarly high species richness with lower associated threats, is key to this process. Hotspots may demand more urgent attention, while coldspots may represent zones of population stability, potentially serving as long-term refugia. In this study, we considered a range of threats to sea lion populations, as detailed in Appendix A.\n\n\n\nLeft: Adult California sea lion (NOAA Fisheries) Right: Steller sea lion (National Geographic)\n\n\n\n\nProblem:\nStrategic conservation planning often involves reconciling different stakeholder priorities. A key debate centers on whether to allocate limited resources toward conserving areas of high biodiversity that are under immediate threat (hotspots) or protecting species-rich regions that face fewer immediate risks (coldspots). With constraints on both funding and capacity, it is crucial to adopt a data-driven approach that balances these competing objectives.\n\n\nApproach:\nWe began by creating a comprehensive species richness layer by summing the individual species distribution layers. Probabilities were converted to binary presence/absence data, where presence (1) represented the upper 50th percentile and absence (0) the lower 50th percentile. “No data” cells were recoded as 0 to simplify subsequent raster calculations.\nThe combined species richness layer was then simplified to show areas of presence for either or both species. Specifically, values of 0 were reclassified as ‘NODATA,’ and values of 1 and 2 (indicating the presence of one or both species) were reclassified as 1.\nNext, a threat layer was introduced, representing the cumulative impact of various threats on the marine environment. This layer was categorized into five equal-area quantiles, from which we generated a high-threat layer by reclassifying all but the highest quantile to ‘NODATA.’ We used the same process to create a low-threat layer, isolating the lowest quantile. We ensured consistency by matching cell size and extent between the threat and species richness layers. Finally, we intersected the high and low-threat rasters with the sea lion species richness layer to show areas of high-threat (hotspots) and low-threat (coldspots) relative to sea lion distribution.\n\n\nResults:\nAs shown in Figure 1, sea lion hotspots are concentrated in the northern portion of their range, particularly along the Pacific Northwest coast. In contrast, cold spots are predominantly found in the southern portion of the species range, off the coast of Southern California and Baja.\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Sealion (Zalophus californianus and Eumetopias jubatus) Hotspots and Coldspots. Red represents hotspots or areas with high sealion biodiversity and high threat. Blue represents the coldspots or areas with high sealion biodiversity and low threat.\n\n\n\n\nConclusions:\nOur results present a clear distinction in the distribution of threats relative to areas with high sea lion species richness. The northern population is under greater threat and, therefore, may require more urgent conservation action. To mitigate these risks, conservation efforts should be focused in the northern range where more biodiverse populations are facing greater threats. However, it is also important to consider conservation actions in coldspots to prevent future threats, and ensure population resilience. Additionally, safeguarding coldspot zones may create refuge areas for sea lions, helping to maintain overall population stability."
