## About me

**Hi, I’m Natalie.**

I’m a scientist, communicator, musician, and crafter – usually daydreaming about climate solutions, native plants, and ways to make the [world a little greener]{style="color:#A8A36C;"}. <img src="images/leaf.png" alt="leaf icon" width="20" height="20"/>

I've compiled some of my recent work here. Feel free to explore and get in touch!
