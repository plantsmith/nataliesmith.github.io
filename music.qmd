Before shifting into environmental work, I spent over five years as a professional musicianâ€”writing, performing, and teaching to diverse audiences. As part of the band **Cape Weather**, I've released 6+ EPs, including the critically acclaimed single Telephono, earning over 3 million [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7J1pOyIKObwsdVRzu4scnI?si=i1E1_BAdS5aBzhBx8xqcDg) streams and placements in film and TV. Our music has been featured on NPR and KCRW, and I collaborated on visually striking [music videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67ifaPm2OCE&list=PLxQOolG5C6cHGcbgSbTJjAV-c7ipobiw1) to bring our songs to life. Beyond Cape Weather, Iâ€™ve performed at 100+ corporate and private events and provided background vocals for artists like Ben Folds.
