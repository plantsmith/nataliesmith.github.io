# Introduction

This work was completed as part of my Master’s Group Project at the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, spanning from April 2024 to April 2025. Our team included Thuy-Tien Bui, Madison Calbert, Andrew Palacios, Priscilla Ta, and myself. We were advised by Dr. Ruth Oliver, and our client was Bill Lehey of LegacyWorks Group.

# Background

Our Master’s Group Project supported the proposed designation of a Vandenberg Sentinel Landscape (VSL) by identifying conservation priorities, implementation barriers, and opportunities for collaboration across California’s Southern Central Coast. We began by interviewing 19 partners to understand their goals and challenges, revealing that biodiversity preservation—including wildlife connectivity and Southern Steelhead recovery—was the region’s top priority. To support these efforts, we conducted a habitat suitability analysis for steelhead and a multispecies connectivity analysis to pinpoint critical conservation areas and movement barriers. Our findings highlighted gaps in monitoring, coordination, and land use compatibility, underscoring the need for expanded partnerships and resource sharing. This work laid the foundation for the VSL designation application and catalyzed the formation of the Vandenberg-Gaviota Landscape Partnership—an important step toward bridging the planning-implementation gap and advancing long-term ecological resilience in the region.

# My Contributions

As Project Manager, I oversaw all aspects of the project to ensure alignment with our client’s goal of applying for designation through the USDA’s Sentinel Landscape Partnership. I managed project timelines, facilitated meetings with clients and advisors, and coordinated collaboration across our five-person team to ensure timely, high-quality deliverables.

In addition to my project management responsibilities, I led the design and execution of interviews with 19 regional partners to identify shared conservation priorities and implementation barriers, and contributed to the analysis of qualitative findings. I also played a key role in the habitat connectivity analysis, using Maxent and Circuitscape to model multispecies movement and identify priority areas for corridor protection, restoration, and barrier mitigation. Additionally, I contributed to creating visualizations, writing report sections, and reviewing project materials to ensure clarity, consistency, and scientific accuracy.
