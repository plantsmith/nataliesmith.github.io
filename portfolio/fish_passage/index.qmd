# Overview

In my analysis, I delved into the adult passage of Coho, Coho Jack, and Steelhead from 2001-2010 at the Willamette Falls fish ladder on the Willamette River (Oregon) using data from Columbia River DART (Data Access in Real Time). My focus was on identifying patterns and trends in fish passage based on time and season. Additionally, I aimed to determine the annual counts for each species. .

## Attach libraries:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(tsibble)
library(feasts)
library(fable)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(viridis)
library(dplyr)
```

## Import and Wrangle Data:

In preparing the data, I transformed it into a time series format and converted the date column from character to date format. I then pivoted the data to consolidate fish species into a single column for streamlined analysis. Finally, any missing values were replaced with zeros to ensure data integrity.

```{r}
# Import Data

willamette_fish <- read.csv(here("portfolio","fish_passage","willamette_fish_passage.csv"))

# Clean up data
wf_clean <- willamette_fish %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(date=lubridate::mdy(date)) %>% 
  as_tsibble(key=NULL,index=date) %>% 
  pivot_longer(!c(project,date),names_to = "species",values_to = "number_of_salmon") %>% 
  filter(species %in% c("coho","jack_coho","steelhead")) %>% 
  replace_na(list(fish_ob=0))

```

## Time Series Graph:

```{r}
#| label: fig-time-series
#| fig-cap: "Time series analysis of adult passage for Coho, Jack Coho, and Steelhead Salmon from 2001 to 2010."
ggplot(wf_clean, aes(x = date, y = number_of_salmon, color = species)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ species, scales = "free_y", ncol = 1, labeller = labeller(fish_species = c("coho" = "Coho", "jack_coho" = "Jack Coho", "steelhead" = "Steelhead"))) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year", date_labels = "%Y") +
  scale_color_viridis_d(name = "species") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

### Major patterns and notable trends:

Coho species exhibit a left-skewed pattern, with passage counts consistently increasing since 2009. Jack Coho species display a more uniform distribution, reaching peak passage counts in 2009. Steelhead demonstrate a consistent seasonal pattern throughout the analyzed time period.

## Monthly and Weekly Seasonal Patterns:

```{r}
#| label: fig-seasonal-patterns
#| fig-cap:  "Total monthly returns of Salmon at Williamette River Dam. Lighter colors indicate later years with darker colors showing earlier years."

wf_season <-wf_clean %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(monthly_count=sum(number_of_salmon))   
  
 wf_season %>% gg_season(y=monthly_count, pal = viridis::viridis(8))+
  facet_wrap(~ species, scales = "free_y", ncol = 1, 
             labeller = labeller(fish_species = c("coho" = "Coho",
                                                  "jack_coho" = "Jack Coho",
                                                  "steelhead" = "Steelhead"))) +
  labs(x='',y='Monthly Fish Passage')+
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%b")

```

```{r}
#| label: fig-week
#| fig-cap: "Total weekly returns of Salmon at Williamette River Dam. Lighter colors indicate later years with darker colors showing earlier years."

wf_weekly <- wf_clean %>%
  index_by(yr_mo=~yearweek(.)) %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(monthly_count=sum(number_of_salmon))   
  
wf_weekly %>% gg_season(y=monthly_count, pal = viridis::viridis(8))+
  facet_wrap(~ species, scales = "free_y", ncol = 1, 
             labeller = labeller(fish_species = c("coho" = "Coho",
                                                  "jack_coho" = "Jack Coho",
                                                  "steelhead" = "Steelhead"))) +
    labs(x='',y='Weekly Fish Passage')+
    theme_minimal()

```

### Key Seasonal Trends:

-   Coho and Jack Coho exhibit a similar seasonal pattern, peaking from September to November. Coho passage has increased in recent years, while Jack Coho passage has declined.

-   Steelhead show a wider seasonal passage window, spanning from February to July, with a peak typically observed from May to July. The timing of peak passage varies across years.

-   Late April and May mark the peak return period for Steelhead, although total returns during this period have declined over the years. This suggests a potential shift in the timing of returns, which is more evident when analyzing the data on a weekly basis.

# Part 3: Annual Counts by Species

## Approach:

To analyze annual counts for each species, I aggregated the data by year and fish species, calculating the total count for each year and species.

```{r}
salmon_by_year <- wf_clean%>%
  group_by(year = lubridate::year(date),species) %>% 
  summarize(annual_count = sum(number_of_salmon)) %>% 
  ungroup()

year_count <- aggregate(annual_count ~ year + species, data = salmon_by_year, FUN = sum)

```

### Annual Count Graph:

```{r}
#| label: fig-annual-count
#| fig-cap: "Annual totals of fish passage for Coho, Jack Coho, and Steelhead Salmon from 2000 to 2010."

annual_salmon_plot_line <- year_count %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = annual_count, color = species)) +
  geom_line() + 
  scale_color_viridis_d() + 
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Count",
       color = "Species") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(min(salmon_by_year$year), max(salmon_by_year$year), by = 1)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

annual_salmon_plot_line

```

### Key Trends in Annual Totals by Species (2000 - 2010):

-   The Coho species demonstrates a left-skewed distribution, with a consistent increase over the years, peaking in 2009, followed by a decline in 2010.
-   Jack Coho species displays a relatively uniform distribution, experiencing a gradual rise in species count from 2007, with a slight decline noted in 2010.
-   Despite seasonal and annual increases and decreases, Steelhead populations are decreasing overall. The increase in 2009 may be a temporary improvement, but it's crucial to analyze more recent data to determine if this is a consistent upward trend or a small fluctuation.
