This is an excerpt from a larger report examining the trade-offs of investing in green companies and divesting from brown companies, developed for a Cost-Benefit Analysis course.

# Introduction

This analysis examines the trade-offs involved in investing in a reduced-carbon portfolio, focusing on the balance between financial returns, environmental costs, and investment risk. Additionally we explored the potential for carbon leakage into brown companies, a critical consideration for understanding the broader environmental impacts of green investing. To address challenges often linked to greenwashing in ESG initiatives, we focused our analysis on renewable energy companies with verifiable, sustainability-driven operations. Using an ex-ante cost-benefit analysis, we assessed the financial and environmental implications of green investments, offering insights into the sustainability trade-offs involved.

# Methods

We examined a diversified portfolio consisting of ten companies: five green firms, which prioritize renewable energy, and five brown firms, which are focused on fossil fuels. This composition allowed for direct comparisons of financial returns and environmental costs across contrasting sectors. The brown firms analyzed were Exxon Mobil, Chevron, BP, ConocoPhillips, and Shell, while the green firms included NextEra Energy, Iberdrola, Enphase Energy, Brookfield Renewable Partners, and First Solar. The environmental metrics for each company were calculated based on their total greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions) for 2023 (measured in MT CO₂e) and the company’s total revenue for the year, as sourced from company reports. Using those figures, we derived an emissions intensity of CO₂e per revenue unit for each company.

## Data Sources and Timeframe

Historical adjusted closing prices (ACP) for each company in the portfolio were sourced from Yahoo Finance. ACP, which adjusts for corporate actions such as dividends and stock splits, provides a more accurate measure of stock value over time. A five-year timeframe (2018–2023) was selected to balance historical stock performance with available greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data, creating a solid foundation for our analysis.

```

```{r}
# Set parameters

#define the date range
start_date <- "2018-01-01"
end_date <- "2023-12-31"

# Define company tickers
tickers <- c("XOM", "CVX", "BP", "COP", "SHEL", "NEE", "IBDRY", "ENPH", "BEP", "FSLR")

# Define carbon intensities for each company (in tonnes of CO2 per unit of revenue)
emissions_intensity  <- c(
  XOM = 0.002,     # Exxon Mobil
  CVX = 0.008,    # Chevron
  BP = 0.002,     # BP
  COP = 0.004,    # ConocoPhillips
  SHEL = 0.004,    # Shell
  NEE = 0.002,     # NextEra Energy
  IBDRY = 0.001,    
  ENPH = 0.00003,  # Enphase Energy
  BEP = 0.000005,  # Brookfield Renewable Partners
  FSLR = 0.0013    # First Solar
)

# Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) in dollars per tonne of CO2
SCC <- 185
```

## Financial Analysis

All stock data were compiled into a single data frame in RStudio (see Appendix A for full code). Daily returns were calculated to assess day-to-day performance. These returns, representing the percentage change in ACP from one day to the next, were generated using the ROC() function with type = "discrete," ensuring returns were calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Return} = \frac{P_t - P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}} = \frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}} - 1
$$

Where Pt is the current adjusted close price, and Pt-1 is the previous day’s adjusted close price. Mean daily returns were annualized by multiplying by 252, the typical number of trading days per year. Volatility, the rate at which the price of a stock fluctuates over time, was then calculated as the standard deviation of annual returns. The result was divided by the square root of 12 to convert this to a monthly measure.

```{r}
#get data to build portfolios
#getSymbols = fetches historical stock data for these tickers from Yahoo Finance

for (ticker in tickers) {
  getSymbols(ticker, src = "yahoo", from = start_date, to = end_date)
}

# Merge adjusted closing prices for all tickers into a single data frame.
prices <- do.call(merge, lapply(tickers, function(ticker) Ad(get(ticker))))

# Calculate daily returns for each stock 
returns <- na.omit(ROC(prices, type = "discrete"))

# Calculate annualized average return.
avg_return <- mean(returns) * 252

# Calculate monthly volatility (standard deviation of returns).
sd_og <- sd(returns)
sd <- sd_og / sqrt(12)

```

## Simulation of Portfolio Performance

A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to model financial and environmental outcomes across 100 randomized scenarios over a 5-year period (60 months). The simulation begins with an initial investment of \$10,000, which was randomly allocated across a portfolio of 10 companies. These allocations were normalized to ensure they summed to 1, ensuring proportional distribution across the portfolio. Monthly returns for each company were generated using a normal distribution based on historical average returns. To reflect monthly values, the mean return was divided by 12, and the standard deviation was adjusted by the square root of 12. Portfolio performance was tracked throughout the simulation by applying monthly portfolio returns, calculated as the weighted sum of company-level returns based on their allocation to the portfolio’s value. Individual company portfolio values were also tracked to assess their contributions to the overall portfolio performance. At the end of each simulation, the cumulative return was determined as the percentage change in the portfolio’s value relative to the initial investment, representing total gain or loss over the 5-year period.

Emissions were calculated for each company by multiplying its allocated portion of the initial investment by its emissions intensity, measured as CO2emission per unit of revenue. These emissions were then multiplied by the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). The total environmental cost for each scenario was obtained by summing the costs across all companies in the portfolio.

Volatility was calculated at both the company and portfolio levels throughout the simulation. Company-level volatility was determined by annualizing the standard deviation of monthly returns, while portfolio volatility represented the overall risk, combining all companies' performance. After completing all 100 scenarios, results were aggregated to analyze trends in financial returns, environmental costs, and volatility, providing insights into the trade-offs between financial and environmental metrics for green and brown firms.

# Results

This analysis examined the mean returns, portfolio growth, environmental costs, and volatility of a diversified portfolio consisting of ten companies—five green firms focused on renewable energy and five brown firms engaged in fossil fuels (Appendix A). The results highlight differences between the two categories, particularly regarding portfolio growth and environmental cost, while volatility remained relatively consistent across both groups ( Figure 1).

## Environmental Costs

Environmental costs showed a significant variation across the companies (Figure 3). The Green firms generally had lower environmental costs over the 5-year scenario, with the exception of NextEra Energy (NEE), which had a moderate environmental cost of \$368.99. In contrast, the Brown firms, particularly Chevron (CVX) and Shell (SHEL), exhibited higher environmental costs, with CVX reaching \$1,492.10 and SHEL at \$750.26. BP and COP also demonstrated notable environmental costs, highlighting the greater ecological impact associated with these companies.

```

## Volatility

Volatility across the companies was relatively consistent, with values ranging from 0.00747 to 0.00765. No significant differences were observed between green and brown firms, suggesting that market risk remained fairly stable across both categories.

# Discussion (Abridged)

Our analysis shows that green companies, especially in renewable energy, outperform brown companies in both financial returns and environmental costs. As seen in Figure 1, top performers like First Solar, Enphase Energy, and Iberdrola achieved high portfolio growth, while maintaining lower environmental costs—less than \$250,000 for Brookfield Energy Partners, Iberdrola, and Enphase Energy. In contrast, brown companies such as Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and Shell had significantly higher environmental costs, with Chevron’s costs more than three times higher than the green companies.

These findings highlight that green energy investments offer both strong financial returns and reduced ecological impact, making them a more sustainable choice as the renewable energy sector grows. A more robust discussion of the results, and shortcomings of green investing, including leakage, greenwashing, and differing scopes, are discussed in the full report.
