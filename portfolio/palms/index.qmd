# Overview:

The palmetto data examines the survival, growth, and biomass estimates of two dominant palmetto species, *Serenoa repens* and *Sabal etonia*, in south Florida from 1981 to 2017, recorded at 5-year intervals. The dataset encompasses various variables, but for this analysis, we will focus on canopy height, length, and width, as well as green leaves.

We aim to create two models with different predictor variables and the better-performing model will be selected. We will then evaluate the success of the chosen model in correctly classifying a plant species.

# Exploratory Plots:

First we want to explore differences in the two species based on canopy height, canopy length, canopy width, and green leaves.

                     aes(x =as.factor(species),
                         y = height)) +

                                italic("S.etonia"))) + 
  labs(x = "Species", y = "Canopy Height") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10),

#Species Boxplot ~ Canopy Length
length_plot <- ggplot(palmetto, 
                     aes(x =as.factor(species),
                         y = length)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "#ADD8E6", color = "#2E75B6",
               alpha = 0.8, 
               outlier.color = "#FF5733",
               outlier.shape = 16,

    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
    legend.position = "none"
  )
# length_plot

```{r}
#Species Boxplot ~ Canopy Width
width_plot <- ggplot(palmetto, 
                     aes(x =as.factor(species),
                         y = width)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "#ADD8E6", color = "#2E75B6",
               alpha = 0.8, 
               outlier.color = "#FF5733",
               outlier.shape = 16, 
               outlier.size = 1) +

  theme(
    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 10),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
    legend.position = "none"
  )
# width_plot

```

### Combined Plot:

```{r}
plot1 <- leaves_plot + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8)) +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank())

plot2 <- height_plot +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8)) +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank())

plot3 <- length_plot +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8)) +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank())

plot4 <- width_plot +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8)) +
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank())
```

Based on our visual exploration, we can see that while the species are very similar, there are species differentiation observed when examining green leaves and canopy length.

```{r}
#| label: fig-combined_plot
#| fig-cap: 'Comparison of species Sabal etonia and Serenoa repens reveals differences and similarities in predictor variables. In combined boxplots, (counter-clockwise from left) we observe a higher count of green leaves in S. repens. In canopy length, we see greater canopy length in S. etonia. Canopy width and height exhibit similar counts.'
combinedplot <- plot1 + plot2 + plot3 + plot4
combinedplot
```

# Models:

To determine whether a plant is *Serenoa repens* or *Sabal etonia*, we need to conduct a binary logistic regression using several predictor variables. We will perform the analysis twice comparing the following models:

-   Model 1: The log odds of plant type using plant height, canopy length, canopy width, and green leaves as predictor variables.
-   Model 2: The log odds of plant type using plant height, canopy width, and green leaves (excluding canopy length for this model).

Note that *S. repens* = speices 1 and *S. etonia* = species 2.

```{r}
# Define formulas:
f1 <- species ~ height + length + width + green_lvs
f2 <- species ~ height + width + green_lvs

# BLR:
blr1 <- glm(formula = f1, data = palmetto, family = binomial)

blr2 <- glm(formula = f2, data = palmetto, family = binomial)

# # Summarize:
# summary(blr1)
# summary(blr2)

```

The coefficients from the binary logistic regression analysis offer insights into the log odds of the predictor variables. In model f1, all predictors have p-values \< 0.5, indicating significance. However, upon removing canopy height from the model in f2, the p-value for height is \> 0.5, suggesting it is no longer a suitable predictor variable. Additionally, Model f1 presents an AIC of 5194.6, while f2 shows an AIC of 5987.5, indicating that f1 is the preferred model.

# Repeated Cross Validation:

Next we need to utilize repeated cross-validation (ten-fold cross-validation) using tidymodels for both models.

```{r}
# Set seed
set.seed(10101)

# Create folds:
surv_folds <- vfold_cv(palmetto, v = 10, repeats = 10)

# Default: 
blr_mdl <- logistic_reg() %>%
  set_engine('glm') 

# Workflows:
blr_wf1 <- workflow() %>%  
  add_model(blr_mdl) %>%
  add_formula(f1)

blr_wf2 <- workflow() %>%  
  add_model(blr_mdl) %>%
  add_formula(f2)

#apply to folded datasetls: 
blr_fit_folds1 <- blr_wf1 %>%
  fit_resamples(surv_folds)

blr_fit_folds2 <- blr_wf2 %>%
  fit_resamples(surv_folds)

# blr_fit_folds1
# blr_fit_folds2

# # Metrics:
# collect_metrics(blr_fit_folds1)
# collect_metrics(blr_fit_folds2)

```

The metrics show:

-   F1 has a mean accuracy of approximately 92% and a mean ROC of approximately 97%.
-   F2 has a mean accuracy of approximately 90% and a mean ROC of approximately 96%.

Based on these metrics, F1 appears to be the better performing model, as it has higher values for both accuracy and ROC.

# Train on Full Dataset:

Now that we have decided the F1 is the better predicting model, we want to train the model on the entire dataset.

```{r}
blr_fit_full <- blr_mdl %>%
  fit(formula = f1, data = palmetto)

palmetto_predict <- palmetto %>% 
  mutate(predict(blr_fit_full,new_data = .))
```

The results of the BLR model are presented below:

```{r}
#| label: fig-table
#| fig-cap: "Binary logistic regression results for the F1 model applied to the entire Palmetto dataset."
# Broom::Tidy 
tidy_output <- tidy(blr_fit_full)

# Create kable table with title
coef_table <- kable(tidy_output, align = "c")%>%
  kable_styling() 

coef_table
```

To assess the model's accuracy for identifying plant species correctly, we need to introduce a conditional argument: if the predicted probability is greater than or equal to 50%, the plant is classified as species 1; otherwise, it is classified as species 2. We can then construct a table illustrating the count of correctly and incorrectly classified plants from the original dataset by the model, as well as a column displaying the percentage of plants correctly classified.

```{r}
# Calculate predicted species based on probabilities and 50% cutoff
palmetto_predict_prob<- augment(blr_fit_full, new_data = palmetto, type.predict = 'response') %>% 
    mutate(predicted_species = ifelse(.pred_1 >= 0.5, "1", "2")) %>%
  select(predicted_species, everything())

```

```{r}
# Create a table of observed and predicted species

# results_table <- table(palmetto_predict_prob %>% 
#   select(predicted_species, species))
# 
# tidy(results_table)

species <- c('S. Repens', 'S. Etonia')
predict_correct <- c(5548,5701)
predict_incorrect <- c(564,454)
percent_correct <- c(91,93)

# Create the data frame
species_correct <- data.frame(species, predict_correct, predict_incorrect, percent_correct)

#kable it
species_correct_kable <- kable(species_correct, align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling() 

species_correct_kable



```
